                    <li>

                        what you can’t allow. In other words,
                        craft out your life, instead of allowing the default state to set it. Program your life where
                        you want it to go.

                propose you get GPA 4.0 (I’ll show you
                how, just stick to the end), but you also need to achieve your real goals. Don’t trade your real goals
                for a 4.0 GPA, and you end up frustrated in life with unmanageable student loans, a less paying job with
                a bad boss or worse, struggling to find a job in the first place.

            <p>Shortly after, another student with the same need asked for my help, this time, offering to pay me. It
                was great because I was still in school and that meant I could get some money to take care of my
                expenses. </p>

            <p>But then, even after turning them down, they still came begging for me to somehow find a way to help
                them, explaining how hard their life circumstances were. </p>
            <br>
            <p>That’s how I ended up recruiting, training, and vetting a team of writers, who have over time, under my
                watch, perfected their writing skills. I still work with them as I always get referrals from clients,

                        <p>There’s almost no case we cannot fix, since they are not major cases for which an explanation
                            to the professor is impossible. However, some cases, just as the professor/instructor know
                            could not be avoided. I will work with you, for FREE to deal with such issues, until they
                            are resolved completely. I will draft letters on your behalf to your instructor and do
                            anything to fix them. The paper may thus be delayed just a while, for which I will notify
                            you in advance. Try sending me your paper as early as possible, just to prevent such cases.
                            In case your paper needs a revision, after the professor grades it, I will do it for FREE,
                            provided you have the paper grading from the professor. </p>

                        <p>Though this is not necessary, because I trust my quality, I will still give you a money-back
                            full refund, if your paper gets a poor grade. </p>

            <p>You’re in this for a couple of years- why not make the best of memories about life, rather than live
                a stressed and unfulfilled life all along.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You are directly responsible to make your life easier, more fulfilling and liberating than it is now. Why
                not do it?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Imagine how much more time, energy and freedom it would be if you escaped all the hassle of completing
                those college assignments.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Why not, from today henceforth, choose to value your peace and satisfaction, freedom, health and
                well-being over things which won’t matter years from now?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Plus, I cover you with a money back guarantee!! No risk on your part. Quality grades or your money
                refunded. </p>
